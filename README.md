# co-motion

## Summary
As a technology company we sit down behind computers a lot. We know that standing desks can help our posture and daily movements significantly however a large proportion of our days are sedentary.

The idea behind co-motion is to encourage all employees (remote and office based) to get moving regularly through gamification. 

- by setting a company wide goal / challenge e.g. Climb Mount everest. Walk around the world etc.
- competing in teams (DEV/PS/Sales/Marketing) to work towards the main target whilst also competing against other teams
- being competitive between individual colleagues with a global league table

## How?
The phones in our pocket are full of sensors, the idea aims to utilise common app API’s such as Moves / RunKeeper / Strava to collect a users step count from their phones and use this data to meet the challenge.

## Why this for lockdown?
- As we look to integrate Contensis with more 3rd party systems, this offers an opportunity to test out authenticating to these systems using oAuth  
- Collecting and displaying rich data is a challenge. We’re looking at ways of displaying richer analytics in Contensis using different charting technologies such as chart.js, high charts or Googles own charting API.
- Building an app using Contensis offers us the chance to see where we need to improve the way we handle data/users/authentication and 3rd party information.
