# Introduction/Hook

"We're changing the way we think about health at Zengenti."

Asked ourselves a question...

"How can we get people to think more about their levels of activity during the day?"
"How can we motivate people to change their habits, permanently?"

Bribes - unsustainable
Humiliation - unethical
Pure 1-2-1 competition - works, but for those who believe they can win

"What motivates people?"

- bigger than themselves
- part of a team
- high performing team, seeing progress 

Changing the way...

Why we created co-motion...healthy competition

# A "details" moment to demonstrate the level of care we took over getting it right

With motivation being key to this we needed goals that inspired people to target them. We modelled the number of steps likely to be taken 
by us all each day and discovered that collectively we'll be climbing the equivalent of many mountains each day. 

[show mountains and steps but without stratosphere] 

but what if reached everest regularly? We wanted to go further....stratoshpere. 

What route would we take? Amazingly, If we walked a virtual line straight to the stratosphere we'd actually reach it more quickly than taking the 
typical route to the top of mount everest. 

We put an imaginary 45 degree slope in there and still it would quicker to walk this then tackle everest. So what did we do?
[image of greek mathermatician] We dusted off our old skool books and employed a bit of trigonomerty to fix it.

We worked out the hyponenuse for each mountain peak from sea level and worked out the ratio between the distance it takes to walk up the 
typical route to the summet and the distance if walked in a straight line at 45 degrees. 
Amazingly they all worked out very near 3.5 times further to walk on land than our imaginary line!

By applying to ratio to the stratosphere we're able to work out how many steps it'll take us to use a mountainous route to the 
stratosphere. 

It would take 10 people an average of X steps per day to reach everest, and X steps in a day to hit the stratosphere.
