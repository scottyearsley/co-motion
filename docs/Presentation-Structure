# Introduction/Hook

"We're changing the way we think about health at Zengenti."

Asked ourselves a question...

"How can we get people to think more about their levels of activity during the day?"
"How can we movtivate people to change their habits, permenantly?"

Bribes - unsustainable
Humiliation - unethical
Pure 1-2-1 competition - works, but for those who believe they can win

"What motivates people?"

- bigger than themselves
- part of a team
- high performing team, seeing progress 

Changing the way...

Why we created co-motion...healthy competition
