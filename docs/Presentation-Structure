# Introduction/Hook

"We're changing the way we think about health at Zengenti."

Asked ourselves a question...

"How can we get people to think more about their levels of activity during the day?"
"How can we movtivate people to change their habits, permanantly?"

As a company we recognised that sitting all day is the new smoking and we did something about it. We now all have the use of standing desks that allow us to sit or stand as we want throughout the day. 

In sport the most successful teams are those that embrace the concept of marginal gains. The idea that enough small changes add up to make a significant overall improvement.

Now that we have people standing while they work we want to get people moving around. So we looked at gamification. 


Gamification

"What motivates people?"

- bigger than themselves
- part of a team
- high performing team, seeing progress 

Changing the way...

Why we created co-motion...healthy competition


# A "details" moment to demonstrate the level of care we took over getting it right

With motivation being key to this we needed goals that inspired people to target them. We modelled the number of steps likely to be taken by us all each day and discovered that collectively we'll be climbing the equivalent of several mountains each day. 

[show mountains and steps but without stratosphere] 

But what if reached everest regularly? We wanted to go furtherâ€¦.so we decided to aim for the stratosphere. 

What route would we take? Amazingly, If we walked a virtual line straight to the stratosphere we'd actually reach it more quickly than taking the 
typical route to the top of mount everest. 

We put an imaginary 45 degree slope in there and it would still be quicker to walk this then tackle everest. So what did we do?
[image of greek mathematician] We dusted off our old school books and employed a bit of trigonometry to fix it.

We calculated the hypotenuse for each mountain peak from sea level and worked out the ratio between the distance it takes to walk up the 
typical route to the summit and the distance if walked in a straight line at 45 degrees. 
Amazingly they all worked out very near 3.5 times further to walk on land than our imaginary line!

By applying to ratio to the stratosphere we're able to work out how many steps it'll take us to use a mountainous route to the stratosphere. 

It would take 10 people an average of 5,800 steps per day to reach everest, and 7,300 steps in a day to hit the stratosphere.
